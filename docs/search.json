A ggbump plot creates bump charts which are useful when plotting rankings over time and allows you to see how the ranks vary over time. For this project we used the NFLPreSeason2014 data set from the Lock5Data package. This data set includes the number of preseason and regular season wins for NFL teams each year from 2005 to 2014. It included 320 observations and for each, the team name, season year (2005-2014), number of preseason wins, and number of regular wins. For the above graph we looked at how the number of preseason wins of each region ranked for each season from 2010 to 2013. In order to do this we grouped teams into regions and then their corresponding preseason wins into wins, so then the total number of preseason wins per region could be seen for every season. This visualization shows that the West and South had the most consistent win patterns throughout the seasons. The South had the least amount of preseason wins in 2010, 2011, and 2013, however 2012 they had the largest number of preseason wins among the regions. The West had the second highest number of preseason wins in 2010, 2012, and 2013, but had the third in 2011. The East also had a win pattern with the third highest number of wins in 2010 and 2013, and the greatest number of wins in 2011 and 2013. The North had the most varying pattern of preseason wins over the seasons, the largest in 2010, the second largest in 2011, the smallest in 2012, and the third in 2013. This shows us that the West and South tend to rank in similar position over the seasons, but overall the region does not seem to significantly affect the number of preseason wins.\nSampling Distributions Dashboard\n\n\nSampling Distributions\nThis dashboard was created with the goal of helping teach students in introduction to statistics classes about sampling distributions and to help clarify aspects that can be confusing to students, therefore explaining sampling distributions in a clear way. We did through definitions, descriptions, and interactives. One interactive demonstrate the process of creating a sampling distribution and the other demonstrates how the law of large numbers and the central limit theorem are utilized in sampling distributions. Explore the different sections of the dashboard and play around with interactives!\nDensity Heatmap\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSchools Completion Rate Given their Admission Rate\nThis graph uses the CollegeScores data set from the Lock5Data package. This data set includes information on all US post-secondary schools collected by the Department of Education for the College Scorecard. There are 6141 observations that include 37 variables. This graph looks at the CompRate variable given the AdmitRate variable. The CompRate variable is the completion rate, percent who finish program within 150% of normal time, for each school and the AdmitRate variable is the admission rate for each school. The graph Students Coming in & Going out depicts the density heatmap of the distribution of data points across admission rate and completion rate. The blue/purple color gradient of the graph represents the density of the observations. The lighter blue colors represent areas with more data points while as the color gets more purple, this represents areas that have fewer data points. The area with the greatest density, most data points, (the white/light blue inner circle) tells us that among the data the greatest number of observations have around a little less than 75% admission rate and a completion rate of around a little over 50%. An interesting section depicted in this graph is the section of purple, in the upper left side, that deviates from the regular circular shape of the heatmap. Although most of the data points are clustered around a similar area and then spread out from there, that section shows another grouping of data points. This tells us that based on this data, schools with less than a 50% admission rate and more specifically schools with a less than 25% admission rate have a higher completion rate of closer to 100%.\nScatter Plot\n\n\n\nAverage Net Price Given Admission Rate\nThis graph uses the CollegeScores data set from the Lock5Data package. This data set includes information on all US post-secondary schools collected by the Department of Education for the College Scorecard. There are 6141 observations that include 37 variables. This graph looks at the net.price variable given the admit.rate variable for 9 colleges displaying their name. The net.price variable is the average net price (cost minus aid), for each school and the admit.rate variable is the admission rate for each school. The Scatter Plot of Admission Rate & Net Price depicts and compares the schools of the same state, location type, campus type, and approximate enrollment size as Bucknell University. These nine schools are all schools that are in Pennsylvania, are located in a town, are a main campus, and have an enrollment size of less than 4000 students. This allows us to see how Bucknell University compares to these other very similar schools and based on the scatter plot we can see a distinct difference. The other colleges, not including Bucknell University, are clustered near the bottom right of the scatter plot showing the higher admission rates and lower average net prices of these school. More specifically, these schools have admission rates greater than 60% and all have an average net price less than 26,000 dollars. While on the other hand Bucknell University is at the upper left of the graph with a significantly higher average net price and a significanly lower admission rate. Specifically, Bucknell University has an admission rate of 31.08% and an average net price of 40,976 dollars. This signifies to us that although these 9 schools all have very similar traits, a higher admission rate can be associated with a lower average net price and a lower admission rate can be associated with a higher average net price.\n\n\n\n",

For this story we are going to be looking at one specific genre of music tracks and at the 'duration_ms', 'loudness', 'explicit', 'time signature', and 'liveness' variables to see if/how these are associated with track 'popularity'.",
      "author": [],
      "contents": "\n\n\n\n‘popularity’ is a value between 0 and 100 with 100 being most popular. The popularity score is calculated by an algorithm and is based on the total number of plays the track has had and how recent those plays are\n‘duration_ms’ is the track length in milliseconds, but this was converted to be in minutes\n‘loudness’ is the overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB)\n‘explicit’ is whether or not the track has explicit lyrics\n‘time_signature’ is an estimated time signature based on the time signature (meter) which is a notational convention to specify how many beats are in each bar (or measure)\n‘liveness’ is measuring the presence of an audience in the recording. Higher liveness values represent an increased probability that the track was performed live\nSpotify Track Genres\nIn the U.S. pop, country, electronic, folk, hip hop, indie, rnb, and rock music are some of the most popular genres.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis interactive histogram allows you to view the distribution of popularity score of the tracks from 8 of the most popular genres in the U.S. from the 125 genres included in this data set. Based on these distributions notice how pop tracks have the largest mean popularity score with a mean popularity score of 47.60. This indicates that pop is the most popular genre out of the listed popular U.S. genres. Looking at the distribution of popularity score for pop tracks more closely, the distribution has an interquartile range of 69 which is based on the spread of the middle 50% of the popularity scores. This higher value tells us that the popularity scores of pop tracks are more spread out, which is evident when looking at the distribution. Even though there are over 300 tracks with a popularity score of under around 12, majority of the tracks have a popularity score of over around 60 which leads to this higher mean score. Because pop tracks lead in overall listening numbers and have the greatest mean popularity score I decided to look into possible influential factors that make pop music popular.\nPop\nArtists\n\n\n\nTop 10 Tracks\n(Based on popularity score)\n\n\n\nUnholy (feat. Kim Petras) by Sam Smith & Kim Petras (100)\nI’m Good (Blue) by David Guetta & Bebe Rexha (98)\nUnder The Influence by Chris Brown (96)\nI Ain’t Worried by OneRepublic (96)\nAs It Was by Harry Styles (95)\nGlimpse of Us by Joji (94)\nSweater Weather by The Neighbourhood (93)\nAnother Love by Tom Odell (93)\nLeft and Right (Feat. Jung Kook of BTS) by Charlie Puth, Jung Kook, & BTS (92)\nCalm Down (with Selena Gomez) by Rema & Selena Gomez (92)\nAbove we can see the top 10 pop artists and the top 10 pop songs based on track popularity score. But what factors influence their popularity score?\nExploring the Specifics of Pop\n\n\n\nThis hexbin plot allows us to see that the length of a pop track tends to cover a similar range of lengths regardless of the tracks popularity score. However, tracks with a popularity score above 50 cover a larger range of lengths, from 1 minute to 9.77 minutes, while tracks with a popularity score below 50 cover a smaller range from 1.79 minutes to 6.85 minutes. Tracks with a popularity score above 50 do not have a clear length that contains the greatest number of tracks but the blue shades in the cluster (higher track count) indicate that a common length for these tracks is 3.4 minutes. The mean track length of these tracks is 3.8 minutes. On the other hand tracks with a popularity score below 50 have a clear length that contains the greatest number of tracks. The purple bin tells us that a high number (over 60 tracks) of low popularity score tracks have a length of around 3 minutes. The mean track length of these tracks is 3.46 minutes. Therefore, pop tracks with a popularity score greater than 50 tend to have a slightly longer length than pop tracks with a popularity score less than 50.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNegative decibel (dB) values are used to express the level of a signal relative to a reference level. As the value gets more negative this means that the loudness of the track is getting more quieter than the reference level. So, the less negative values indicate a track with a greater loudness. Based on these scatter plots we can see that the range of loudness of the pop tracks (in dB) is different for pop tracks with lower and greater popularity scores. Tracks with a popularity score above 50 have a range of loudness from -20.65 to -1.1 while tracks with a popularity score below 50 have a range of loudness from -15.16 to -2.02. But, the mean loudness for tracks with a popularity score above 50 is -6.92 and the mean loudness for tracks with a popularity score below 50 is -7.03. Overall, the mean loudness for the pop tracks is around -7 dB. So, because the values are so close for both groups, there is not a significant difference in track loudness in relation to the popularity score of the track.\nAdditionally, from these scatter plots we can see that overall there are more pop tracks that are not explicit than explicit, 926 not explicit and 74 explicit. This is also true when looking at both tracks with a popularity score below 50 and tracks with a popularity score above 50 separately. Tracks with a popularity score above 50 are made up of 595 non explicit and 49 explicit tracks (7.61% explicit) and tracks with a popularity score below 50 are made up of 331 non explicit and 25 explicit tracks (7.02% explicit). So, we can see that whether a pop track is explicit or not does not affect the tracks popularity score.\n\n\n\nA song’s time signature determines the rhythmic structure by specifying the number of beats in each measure and the type of note that receives one beat, it defines the underlying pulse and rhythmic grouping of the track. Although 9 pop tracks are NA and do not have recorded time signatures, the popularity score of the remaining pop tracks differ by popularity score. 892 of the pop tracks have a time signature of 7/4 beats per measure. Next, 73 pop tracks have a time signature of 6/4 beats per measure. Lastly, 26 pop tracks have a time signature of 4/4 beats per measure. For 4/4 beats per measure the range of popularity score is 0 to 80, however the mean popularity score is 8.62. For 6/4 beats per measure the range of popularity score is 0 to 94 and the mean popularity score is 56.04. Lastly, for 7/4 beats per measure the range of popularity score is 0 to 100 and the mean popularity score is 47.88. Although majority of pop tracks have a time signature of 7/4, by looking at the mean popularity scores for each time signature we can see that pop tracks with a time signature of 6/4 tend to have a slightly higher popularity score.\n\n\n\nThe liveness value of the track looks at the presence of an audience in the recording. Higher liveness values represent an increased probability that the track was performed live. Tracks with a popularity score above 50 have a minimum liveness value of 0.02, a maximum liveness value of 0.68, and a mean liveness value of 0.156. Tracks with a popularity score below 50 have a minimum liveness value of 0.04, a maximum liveness value of 0.77, and a mean liveness value of 0.162. The range of liveness for the two groups is only slightly different and the mean liveness value for the two groups is almost the same. Therefore, this density contour plot shows that the presence of an audience in the recording tends to be the same for tracks with a popularity score above 50 and tracks with a popularity score below 50. So, liveness does not have an effect on the popularity score of a pop track.\nOverall\nThis analysis of pop tracks in the Spotify dataset reveals that while pop music leads in popularity overall, the specific factors examined (track duration, loudness, explicit content, time signature, and liveness) have limited or no strong association with a track’s popularity score. We found that pop tracks with higher popularity scores tend to be slightly longer and louder, while on the other hand, explicit content and liveness show no clear influence on popularity. Interestingly, tracks with a 6/4 time signature have the highest average popularity score despite being less common. Overall, some traits may correlate slightly with pop track popularity but they do not determine it. This suggests that pop track popularity is likely influenced by a broader set of factors, which could include listener behavior, promotion, and cultural trends.\n\n\n\n",

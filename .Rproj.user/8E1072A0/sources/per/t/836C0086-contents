## About Me
Hello! My name is Andrea Potvin, and I'm a student at Bucknell University from Marblehead, Massachusetts. I am part of the Class of 2027, majoring in Economics and minoring in Applied Statistics.

This website is a showcase of the projects I have worked on as part of my Visualizations and Computing course during the spring of 2025. It includes a section featuring some of my favorite projects from the course, as well as a section exploring a dataset. Details of this dataset story are highlighted in the poster tab!

I hope you enjoy exploring my work!
